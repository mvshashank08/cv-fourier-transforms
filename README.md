# Fourier Transforms, Image Pyramid
This repository is a part of my coursework toward the course `CS 682` **Computer Vision** at *George Mason University (GMU)*.

The task focuses the following sections:
1. Image Filters
    * Common image filters
    * Image derivatives
    * Gaussian Filtering
    * Derivative of convolution
2. Image Upsampling
    * Upsampling kernels
    * Upsampling with Fourier transforms
3. Hybrid Images
4. Image Pyramid

## Libraries
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `PIL`
